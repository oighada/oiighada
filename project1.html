<h2 id="pere"> Tourism in Italy </h2>
<h4> 
With 52.4 million tourists a year (2016), Italy is <br>
the fifth most visited country in international tourism arrivals.<br> 
[1] People mainly visit Italy for its rich culture, cuisine, history,<br>
fashion and art, its beautiful coastline and beaches, its mountains,  <br>
and priceless ancient monuments. Italy also contains more World Heritage <br>
Sites than any other country in the world. Tourism is one of Italy's fastest <br>
growing and most profitable industrial sectors, with an estimated revenue of €189.1 billion. <br>  </h4>

<h2 id = "pere3" > Food in Italy </h2>
<h4> 

Fresh, flavorful, and delightfully simple, the sun-kissed Italian cuisine<br> 
is dolce vita on the plate. But, for finding the best food in a country with such<br> 
fabulous regional gastronomies, the best advice would be to forget about restaurants<br>
that serve “creative, innovative” fare, and just stick to the local, time-honored specialties.<br>
Eating is one of the greatest joys of traveling in Italy, a vivid insight into each region’s <br>
culture and traditions. Their dishes are made with seasonal, unpretentious ingredients,<br>
yet they taste like something you’d get in a Michelin-starred restaurant.<br>
To try to determine which of Italy’s amazing foods are the “best” is like trying to<br> 
prove pizza is better than pasta – it’s strictly a matter of personal taste and I know everyone<br>
is going to have their own opinion. As an avid foodie, however, I couldn’t resist the temptation<br>
of putting together a list of 10 of the best things to eat in Italy. Of course, this is a completely<br>
subjective selection, so feel free to disagree in the comment below: <br>
